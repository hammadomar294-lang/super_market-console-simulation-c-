## Overview

A console-based supermarket management system implemented in C++ using layered architecture principles.

The project focuses on clean separation of responsibility between system layers and selecting data structures based on time complexity requirements.

It simulates inventory management, cart operations, persistence, and analytics using custom Binary Search Trees.

---

## Architecture

Project structure follows a layered system design:

classes/

domain/ → business entities (Product, Category, Cart, Order, User)

persistence/ → file loading & saving

BST_analytics/ → custom BST-based ranking engine

store/ → inventory and checkout orchestration

interface/ → console menus and navigation

---

## Features

Inventory management using unordered_map for O(1) lookup

Category-based restocking thresholds

Cart system with undo / redo support using stack

Sales analytics using custom Binary Search Trees

FIFO order processing simulation using queue

Persistent storage for products, categories, and sales

Automatic ID synchronization after loading data

---

## Data Structures Used

unordered_map → fast product/category lookup O(1)

vector → cart storage

stack → undo / redo operations

queue → FIFO order processing simulation

Binary Search Tree → sales and price analytics

---

## Design Focus

This project emphasizes:

time complexity awareness when selecting data structures

clean separation of responsibility between system layers

encapsulation of domain logic inside entity classes

modular system architecture suitable for extension

---

## Project Status

Completed:

Domain layer

Persistence layer

Analytics layer (BST ranking engine)

Currently working on:

Store orchestration layer and checkout workflow
